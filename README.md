# Global-Horizontal-Irradiance-Analysis
<br>

🌞 Mapping Solar Potential with GHI Data 🌏
Excited to share my recent project on visualizing Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), a critical parameter for solar energy assessment and planning. Leveraging data from the Global Solar Atlas—a robust platform developed by the World Bank Group—I created a detailed map showcasing the solar energy potential for a specific region. <br>
🔍 About the Data

Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) represents the total amount of solar radiation received on a horizontal surface. It is one of the most critical parameters for solar energy assessments and photovoltaic (PV) system design. For my analysis, I utilized data from the Global Solar Atlas, a robust platform providing free access to high-resolution solar resource data. <br>

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

To bring this visualization to life, I utilized Python and the following powerful libraries:
Geopandas for spatial data handling.
Rasterio for raster data processing.
Matplotlib and Cartopy for high-quality visualizations.
Pandas for data organization and analysis.
